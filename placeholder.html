      A few ways in which you can help to keep Florida's Panthers from going
      extinct are:
    </h2>

    <p class="intro-p text-container-p">
      The Florida Panther was placed on the extinction list in 1967 with an
      estimated low of 10 panthers. Since they were placed on that list and a
      habitat conservation plan was put in place in 1994 there has been an
      increase to an estimated 200 panthers though they remain on the endangered
      species list and placed on a 5-year review according to the Endangered
      Species Act of 1973.

      Resource 1: "Does Hunting Activity for Game Species Have Indirect Effects
      on Resource Selection by the Endangered Florida Panther?"
      <p>
        Key Takeaways: Hunting fair game still has an impact on other species
        that rely on those species in their diet. Therefore there is something
        to be said about the extent that we allow fair game to be hunted,
        because after a certain point it still circles back to impacting the
        endangered Florida Panthers
      </p>

    <p class="intro-p6 text-container-p6">
      “Hunting activities can affect game species in several ways; however,
      indirect effects of hunting on non-game species have received less
      attention than direct effects on game species, even though such potential
      effects could be crucial in some situations. There is ongoing concern that
      the critically endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi may be
      influenced by hunting activity, in terms of changes in panther resource
      selection and distribution.” (McCarthy et al. 2015)

      Resource 2: "Florida Panther Habitat Use: New Approach to an Old Problem."
      <p>
        Key Takeaways: Florida panther conservation is highly connected to more
        forests being made safe havens for the panther population. This means as
        a community we must urge for Panther safe havens to be centered in
        forrests now that we know that is where they thrive rather than other
        less wooded ecosystems in Florida.
      </p>

    <p class="intro-p6 text-container-p6">
      "We recommend that managers give forests highest consideration when
      conserving this endangered species and suggest the further evaluation of
      the habitat value of natural openings that occur in close proximity to
      forested panther range."(Cox et al. 2006)

      Resource 3: "A Habitat Assessment for Florida Panther Population Expansion
      into Central Florida."
      <p>
        Key Takeaways: There is a Florida Panther Recovery plan in place that
        plans to slowly reestablish a more secured population. This study took
        place in 2006 and yet we are still recovering our Florida Panther
        population to a more stable number. The study also highlights that these
        efforts will have to extend pass Florida and request the same recovery
        methods be adopted in other willing and able states.
      </p>
    </h2>

    <p class="intro-p6 text-container-p6">
      "The goal of the Florida Panther Recovery Plan is to establish and
      maintain a total population of more or equal to 240 animals within the
      historic panther range to avoid extinction due to demographic and genetic
      processes(United States Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). Although
      successful population establishment in the study area could help protect
      the current panther population from extinction caused by stochastic
      events, it would not be adequate to reach that recovery goal. Thus, the
      reestablishment of panthers in other areas within historic range will
      likely be necessary (Thatcher et al. 2006)"
